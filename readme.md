Hello dear students,

In this project, you are going to practice :

    - Database Connection (H2 and Postgres),
    - Basic table creation, 
    - Establishing Relations,
    - Populate Tables with Data.sql file...

This project is ready enough to start... You are responsible
to write your code step by step in order to achieve:

step_1 : establish H2 and Postgres database connection,
step_2 : create tables via hibernate annotations,
step_3 : establish entity relations (look into resources/static folder)
         and update tables with relations added
step_4 : populate tables with Data.sql file...

Thank you and have a nice time...
